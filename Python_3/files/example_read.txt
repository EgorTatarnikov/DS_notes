So far, the data we have used in this book have all been either coded right into the program, or have been entered by the user. In real life data reside in files. 
For example the images we worked with in the image processing unit ultimately live in files on your hard drive. Web pages, and word processing documents, and music are other examples of data that live in files. 
In this short chapter we will introduce the Python concepts necessary to use data from files in our programs.
